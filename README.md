# a02 Like building a house

In this assignment, you will download and install Bulma, a CSS framework, using NPM. 
You will then incorporate the framework into some HTML starter code that we have provided.

Directly writing raw, static HTML and CSS is feasible for smaller sites like the mythical one you designed for a01. But it’s easy to see how designing a website from scratch can be difficult—especially for large, complex, dynamic sites containing many pages.

And although every website you have ever used is ultimately expressed in terms of CSS and HTML, modern web developers typically have many tools at their disposal to help organize the code, reduce unnecessary duplication, and promote best practices. In this course, we will continue to become familiar with some of these tools.

## What is a framework?

Frameworks are widely employed for assisting with web development. A framework is a structural code library that enforces an organizational scheme on the code that you write, with the goal of helping you to produce better software. Here are a few of the benefits of using a framework to organize your application:

- It speeds up the development process
- It makes your code easier to read
- It reduces the potential for bugs
- It prevents code replication
- It encourages you to conform to best practices
- It provides pre-written solutions to common tasks that you are likely to encounter

> A framework is typically written for a particular language and is designed to help you write a particular type of software. For example, Angular, React, and Vue are examples of JavaScript frameworks designed to help you write organized JavaScript code for the browser. We’ll learn more about these frameworks later the semester.

## CSS frameworks for web development

CSS is what we use to make the web and web-based applications look and act for the people using them. CSS frameworks jumpstart the process of developing the user interface layer of our applications.

In this assignment we will be exploring [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), an open source CSS framework designed to help you organize the way you add style to HTML pages. By linking Bulma to your HTML pages and adding a few special classes to your HTML elements, you can quickly make a webpage that looks good and follows best design practices, all without having to write any custom CSS.

> While Bulma is a great CSS framework, it’s not the only one out there. These blog posts list other CSS frameworks that are also popular right now. You are likely aware of other frameworks, such as: Bootstrap, Materialize, Foundation, and Tailwind, among others. When planning a new web app, picking a CSS framework can be difficult, and there are a lot of factors to consider. Ultimately, try to choose a framework that will allow you to rapidly produce well-designed pages.

CSS frameworks are a quick and easy way to make pretty and functional websites, but they’re no substitute for understanding the underlying CSS rules that are being applied. For this course, it’s important to have a working understanding of the fundamentals before diving fully into using framework. This assignment is intended to get you to a place where you understand what a framework (in this case a CSS framework) does and how to integrate it into your work.

## Getting started

1. To get started, follow the GitHub Classroom invite link for a02, which will be listed on Sakai and Piazza.

2. As with previous assignments, clone the repository that is created for you to your local environment. It contains some starter code.

3. Some starter code has been provided for you. You should see some HTML, some custom CSS (do not edit this file at all), a list of the Bulma classes you will need to use (also listed in a table below), a directory of some images, a license, and a README file.

4. Next, open a terminal in the a02 assignment directory and initialize a new npm project for a02 using the npm init command (see a00 if you need a refresher).

5. When you initialize the npm project, fill in the fields that it prompts you to fill with information relevant to you (e.g., your name, etc). MOST IMPORTANTLY: update the license to match the license in the LICENSE file, when it prompts you to do so. Look in the LICENSE and figure out what license is in there. [HINT: GitHub will tell you which licence you are using if you open the LICENSE file in GitHub.] You can then use the SPDX License List to get the correct identifier that matches. If you do not do this during the init process, don’t worry! You can always edit the packages.json file after it has been created.

6. It would behoove you to add a .gitignore file to your repository so that your repo doesn’t track all the dependencies you install. This one is very good.

7. While you have the terminal open, also add Browsersync as a dependency to your new project (using the command npm install browser-sync). It will make your life easier.

8. This is a good time to use git add and git commit so that you can ensure that the new files you just created are being tracked.

9. Start Browsersync from your terminal (browser-sync start -sw) and see how the HTML files look when rendered in the browser. Since we only have the custom starter CSS, they should look pretty plain.

## Installing Bulma

In this assignment, we are going to add Bulma styles to the raw HTML provided in the assignment directory. The goal is to use Bulma to improve the way this page looks, all without writing a single line of CSS.

Since Bulma is a CSS framework, it is essentially one giant pre-written CSS stylesheet. In order to start styling our pages with Bulma, we need to first link the HTML to the Bulma CSS. Recall from a01 that CSS stylesheets can be linked to HTML documents by adding a special `<link>` tag inside the `<head>` of the document.

However, this raises an important question: where should we store the giant Bulma CSS stylesheet, and what path do we put in the `<link href="">` attribute in order to link to it?

Generally speaking, there are three feasible possibilities:

1. Download the Bulma CSS file manually, save it in the `a02-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME` directory, and `<link>` to it with a relative path.

2. In the HTML file, `<link>` directly to an online version of the Bulma CSS file hosted by a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

3. Download the Bulma CSS file as a dependency using npm, and `<link>` to the downloaded file relatively from `node_modules`.

> A Content Delivery Network, or CDN, is a giant network of servers geographically spread across a large region—like the country, the continent, or the world. The servers in a CDN work together to deliver website data such as video, images, audio, html, etc. to users as fast and as reliably as possible. By spreading out the servers across the world, there is a greater chance that any given user will be geographically close to a CDN server. If the closest server in the network responds to a user’s request, it’s likely that the response will arrive even faster.

These three options are discussed in more detail on the official getting started with Bulma page. Using npm to install the package as a dependency is the recommended option, so that’s what we will do for this assignment. In general, installing packages through npm is the best route when you need to add third party code to your web apps for this course.

## Add Bulma as a dependency

Therefore, to download Bulma as a dependency, run the following command from the terminal in your a02-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME directory:

`$ npm install bulma`

> Note: You may still have Browsersync running in your terminal. Thus, to run `npm install bulma`, you either need to open a new terminal from the `a02-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME` directory (right click your `a02-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME` directory and select “Open in Terminal”), or you need to kill the Browsersync process with Ctrl + C to free up the existing terminal instance.

## Finding the Bulma stylesheet

Now that Bulma has been downloaded, the next step is to connect the CSS to the HTML by adding `<link>` tags in the `<head>` of the HTML documents. But what URL should we use as the href attribute of the `<link>` tag? We need to look at the files that were downloaded by npm and find the correct CSS file.

Every time you npm install a new dependency, npm automatically downloads the requested files from the internet and puts them in a special directory named node_modules. This process occurred when you ran npm install bulma, meaning the Bulma files are now ready and waiting in the node_modules directory in your `a02-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME` directory. Open node_modules now and confirm that bulma has been downloaded. When you expand the directorys, it should look something like this:

![](images/bulma-code.png)

Inside of the new `a02-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME/node_modules/bulma` directory is a list of files and directories that collectively make up Bulma. In particular, you’ll notice a sub-directory named css, which contains three files:

- node_modules/css/bulma.css
- node_modules/css/bulma.css.map
- node_modules/css/bulma.min.css

The two files that end in .css are exactly what we’re looking for! In fact, both `bulma.css` and `bulma.min.css` represent complete copies of the Bulma CSS source code, and either one would work for this assignment.

What is the difference between the two files? `bulma.min.css` is a minified version of Bulma, which means the CSS code was purposefully compressed to take up as few characters as possible. All newlines and whitespace are gone from the code, meaning it has a smaller file size and is therefore faster to transfer across the internet. Your browser doesn’t need the extra whitespace, and is perfectly happy reading and understanding the minified version. However, minified code is generally much harder for humans to read!

## Linking to Bulma in HTML

Now that we found the location of the Bulma CSS stylesheet, we can link it to the HTML file. The file we want is located at `node_modules/bulma/css/bulma.css` relative to the `a02-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME` root directory.

Add the following line inside the `<head>` of the HTML document in a02:

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/bulma/css/bulma.css">`

Make sure to place it above `<link rel="stylesheet" href="custom_style.css">` but DO NOT remove this line. You need both.

__THIS ONE LINE will be the only line you add to index.html. You should not add any other lines to this file.__

## Revisit rendered pages

Just by linking to Bulma, the provided HTML page already look much better! Go ahead and take a look. If Browsersync is not running, start it up again and head to http://localhost:3000 on Google Chrome to see the rendered version.

Bulma automatically adds default styles to your page that affect little things like the default font family, font colors, font sizes, heading sizes, paragraph spacing, etc. Though subtle, these changes are important! They were carefully chosen by the Bulma team to reflect recommended best practice for web design.

> If you’re interested in learning more about best practices for good web style and design, there are lots of online resources available in the guides pages). In particular, typography is the art of formatting text to be practical, effective, readable, and stylish.

## Adding Bulma classes

The default styles added to your page by linking to Bulma are just the beginning. The real power of Bulma comes with its CSS classes. Bulma defines and styles hundreds of little utility CSS classes for use in your HTML.

Need to change the background color of a `<div>` and make it yellow? Bulma pre-defines a CSS class for that.

Need to add a red glow to a form input field when the user types an invalid value? There’s a class for it.

What about laying content side-by-side? Or making a table pretty? Or increasing the size of the text in a particular area? Or changing the font-family? Or giving buttons different colors? Bulma has classes for all of these too.

Bulma offers too many CSS classes to cover in one assignment or project. However, you should become familiar with the official Bulma documentation, which is an excellent resource for getting to know your way around the framework and even gives code examples demonstrating what each CSS class does.

Go to the Bulma documentation and click through the menu on the right side of the page (see screenshot below). For the next part of the assignment, you will use Bulma classes to improve the design of the provided a02 HTML document.

![](images/docs.png)

## Submission requirements

For this assignment, your task is to correctly add Bulma classes to the `a02-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME/index.html` HTML document to make it look exactly like the screenshots linked below.

NOTE:

1. You may not change the HTML elements on the page at all, except for adding Bulma classes.
2. You also may not add any custom CSS styles or edit `custom_styles.css`.

You are required to reproduce the style from the screenshots exactly. To make this easier, we have included a table below containing all the classes you’ll need to use. You’ll also notice that as a hint, some of the elements in the HTML file already have their classes defined; there is no need to add or remove classes from these elements.

> Some IDEs provide automatic autocomplete when you start typing Bulma classes. This functionality is built in to Webstorm, but if you want Bulma class autocompletion on Visual Studio Code, you’ll have to add it as an extension.

Per usual, make sure to frequently commit your code changes in case you need to roll them back.

## Website Screenshots

Here are screenshots of the website that you are trying to create. To get full credit on this assignment, your website must automatically match all these images by correctly using only the Bulma classes listed in the next section.

## Classes to Use

Notice how the table below isn’t just a list of classes used, but a list of classes to be used to style individual html elements. There is no mixing and matching necessary among the rows of the table.

For example, when you see subtitle has-text-grey has-text-weight-light you can assume that this is styling a single html element. In this case it styles the subtitle on line 77. You won’t see combinations other than the ones listed in the table below.

Class List [Documentation Section]
- [ ] button is-dark [Buttons]
- [ ] checkbox [Forms] 
- [ ] column [Columns/Layout]
- [ ] columns

## Wrap-up

This assignment is more involved and more difficult than the previous two. We are actually getting into connecting visual elments with the code that makes them.

We are also getting deeper into troubleshooting and figuring out what is happening in your code.

Nothing is impossible. Take your time. Look around in the HTML before you just start editing.

Remember the above directive that you should only add one line to index.html. That is not a recommendation. If you add other lines to the file, the tests will fail. If you edit custom_styles.css, the tests will fail.

The assignment will be evaulated entirely on whether you are able to apply the classes to elements within index.html. And guess what: you are capable of doing this.

And we’re here to help if needed. Post your questions on Piazza and we’ll help you work through issues.
